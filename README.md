=================================

Results of a [DesignDEVS](http://www.autodeskresearch.com/projects/designdevs) [Simple Hotel Simulation](https://git.autodesk.com/research-ee/designDEVS-hotel-simulation)

The simulation and data was used in these publications:

- [Towards Voxel-Based Algorithms for Building Performance Simulation](http://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/voxelbasedbps)
- [Towards Visualization of Simulated Occupants and their Interactions with Buildings at Multiple Time Scales](http://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/multitimescales)
